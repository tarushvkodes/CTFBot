# CTFBot Development Plan

## Project Overview
CTFBot is a web-based assistant for CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions that leverages Google's Gemini API to analyze challenges, suggest approaches, and generate hints in real-time.

## Core Functionality
1. **Challenge Analysis**
   - Auto-detection of challenge types (cryptography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, etc.)
   - Quick assessment of provided challenge files or descriptions

2. **Solution Generation**
   - Step-by-step solution approaches
   - Scalable hint system (from subtle hints to more explicit guidance)
   - Code generation for common CTF tasks

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - Real-time explanations of security concepts and vulnerabilities
   - Tool recommendations for specific challenge types

## Technical Implementation
1. **Frontend**
   - HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based static site (GitHub Pages compatible)
   - Modern, clean Apple-inspired design
   - Atkinson Hyperlegible font for accessibility
   - Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile
   - Smooth animations and transitions

2. **Backend/API Integration**
   - Client-side integration with Gemini API
   - Prompt engineering for CTF-specific contexts
   - Local storage for saving history and preferences

3. **Feature Roadmap**
   - Phase 1: Basic challenge analysis and hint generation
   - Phase 2: Challenge categorization and specialized responses
   - Phase 3: History tracking and solution saving
   - Phase 4: Community features (optional - would require backend)

## Implementation Priorities
1. Create basic UI with input/output interface
2. Implement Gemini API integration
3. Develop CTF-specific prompt engineering
4. Add responsive design and animations
5. Implement history/context saving
6. Add challenge type detection
7. Create specialized tools for common CTF categories

## Design Principles
- Clean, minimalist Apple-inspired design
- Accessible typography with Atkinson Hyperlegible
- Dark/light mode support
- Intuitive, friction-free UX
- Mobile-first responsive approach

## Security Considerations
- Client-side API key handling
- User data privacy
- Safe code execution considerations
